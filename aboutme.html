        <p>The city that I lived in is called Bandung.</p>
        <p>Fun fact, it is regarded as the city of flower, mainly because there used to be so much flower.</p>
        <p>It is pretty similar to any other cities, crowded, noisy during the day and as it is Indonesia,</p>
        <p id="traditional"><i><b>Very Traditional.</b></i></p>
        <p>I have lived my whole life there before moving to Australia, and leaving my home country allows me to appreciate it more.</p>

        <h1 id="title"><u>My Achievement</u></h1>
        <p>I have never really been to that many competitions, but I used to play a lot of basketball for my school.</p>
        <p>Like any competitions, there will be the winner and the loser. Sometimes we're lucky enough to get first place, but other times we fell short.
           Academically, I'm not a brightest student either, my biggest achievement was getting up to top three but that's it. Gaming-wise, I used to play a lot of dota2, and me alongside with my friends won several LAN competitions which I am proud of as we earned some cash out of it as well.</p>
